1) Sparsity of the Data

What should I do about how sparse some of this ILO data is? 
What I've tried:
* Imputation
* Removing sparse variables (Restricted Dataset)

2) Imputing

Should I even be imputing the data? I'm imputing without the output variable, etc. but the results are hardly better than the models where the imputed data is not present.
Eric mentioned that it would be best to treat each county as a fixed effect. That said, the way I impute means each country is tied together. I need a way to impute for each country, including the ones with no data for particular features.

3) Inequality

Should I use the log of the fractional inequality or the difference inequality?

4) Interpretations

How should I go about creating visualizations for regression models?
