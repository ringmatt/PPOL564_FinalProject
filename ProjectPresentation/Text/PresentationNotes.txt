[SLIDE 0] - Problem Statement

[SLIDE 1] - Background

## Reasoning
* Spend 1/3 of your adult life at work (WHO)

## Data
* Sources
    * Labor Statistics
    * Happiness 
    * Polity Data
    * GDP per Capita
	
[SLIDE 1.1]

* Inputs - 11 Features Available
	* Labor, Polity, Economic
* 1 Output - 0 to 10 Cantril's Ladder

[SLIDE 2] - Methods Considered

## 1. Data
    
## 2. Models
* Models - Wanted at least one that was interpretable and one that was accurate
* Assessment
    * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Cross Validation
    * K-Fold
    * Bootstrapping   

## 3. Visualizations
* Correlation Matrix - Multicollinearity
* Feature Importance Bar Chart
* Cross Validation Learning Curves - Overfitting

[SLIDE 3] - Methods Used

## 1. Data

* Cleaning
    * Removed data missing all but life satisfaction

* Feature Engineering
    * Fractional Inequality - Top 20%'s earnings / bottom 20%'s
    * Differential Inequality - Top 20%'s - Bottom 50%'s

* Elimination
    * Avoid multicollinearity
	
* Cross-Validation
    * K-Fold
	
* Preprocessing - Continuous variables only
    * Scales to unit variance and sets the mean to 0
    
### Constructed Datasets

1. Full Data
    * More observations, more features, more NaNs
2. Restricted Data
    * Fewer observations, fewer features, no NaNs
3. Imputed Data
	* Sci-kit learn's built in function
    * More observations, more features, no NaNs, questionsable filled values


[SLIDE 3.1] - Correlation Matrix

* Includes variables found in the imputed data
* The restricted data does not contain average work week hour or Union Coverage
* Removed the redundant variables  Differential Inequality, Union Density, and Democracy,
	* Just different versions of Fractional Inequality, Union Coverage, and Electoral Democracy Index
* Uses Person's r, where .3 is a moderate correlation and .5 is strong or large. No points approach a strong correlation
	
[SLIDE 4] - Methods Used (Continued)

## 2. Algorithms

1. LR
    * Rationale - Interpretable
	* Issue: - Not accurate for complex relationships
2. KNN
    * Rationale - Accuracte - Good for low dimensional datasets?
	* Issue: Scales poorly - Runs slowly
3. SVR
    * Rationale - Accurate - Good for Complex Data
	* Issue: Very difficult to interpret
4. Random Forest
    * Rationale - Interpretable
	
## 3. Fixed Effects

* Cultural difference that impact self-reported happiness
	
[SLIDE 5] - Preliminary Results

## Best Model
* Restricted Data
	* KNN was always the best performing algorithm
* Imputed Data - Used KNN but had an MSE of 0.23

## Fixed Effects OLS

* Ran on each datasets

* Significant variables

* Not including the countries

* and their coefficients

[SLIDE 5.1] - Feature Importances

* Notice GDP's high importance and Inequality's meh importance
	
[SLIDE 6] - Preliminary Conclusions

2. Most Important Feature(s)
    * GDP in KNN - Highest feature importance
    * AFI in Fixed Effect - Most commonly significant
        * But it has completely different effects when using the restricted data

# <u> Lessons Learned / Future Work <u>    
    
## 1) Data Sparsity

* Goal was to determine the impact of work statistics on happiness

* Had to remove them to make effective models

* Monthly earnings - Multicolinear with GDP?
	
## 2) Models
* Other Models
    * Have not performed well with any subset of hypterparameters
* Cross Validation
	* Learning curves
    * Overfitting?
	
[SLIDE 7] - Lessons Learned Cont.
    
## 3) Interpretations
* Partial Dependency Plots
	* Impact of features of interest, such as inequality or wages
* Fixed Effects
	* How to assess the impact of different variables within a country
* Feature Importances
    * For regression
