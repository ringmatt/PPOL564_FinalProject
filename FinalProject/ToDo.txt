1. Add Mean Monthly Earnings [CHECK]
	1. See what this correlates with - Especially GDP  [CHECK]
2. Root Mean Squared Error [CHECK]
	1. as Standard Deviations of the dependent variable
3. Learning Curves [CHECK]
	1. Create for the KNN model's specifications to ensure there isn't any overfitting
4. Partial Dependency Plots
	1. Assess for inequality, wages, etc.
5. Academic Freedom [CHECK]
	1. Assess differing impact when different variables are present [CHECK]
	2. Find confounder?
	3. Remove [CHECK]
	4. Results
		1. Removing AFI bring the number of observations up to 1546 from 1240 (25% increase)
6. Feature Importances
7. Fixed Effects
	1. Tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability with many dummy variables?
	2. Interpretations?
	3. Results
		1. Adding Min Wage, Mean Monthly Earnings, and Gender Pay Gap (In any set
		2. Replacing Average Hours Worked with Min Wage changed the only important feature in the full set from AFI to GDP
		3. Min Wage will be used as it contains less missing values and has similar collinearity to hours worked
		4. Addition of Min Wage does not change much
		5. Removing AFI makes diagonal accountability no longer significant for the restricted and imputed set
			1. GDPpc becomes significant for the full dataset
			2. EDI becomes significant for the imputed dataset
		6. More country effects become significant when removing AFI
