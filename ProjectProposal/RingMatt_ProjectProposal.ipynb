These data come from Gallup World Polls and are used by the World Happiness Report. Variables include, but are not limited to, country name, region, happiness score, freedom, generosity, and trust in government. These are stored in .csv files, separated by year, which would need to be merged. \n",

Years range from 2005 to 2018, dependent on the country. Our World in Data’s article [Happiness and Life Satisfaction](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction) (Ortiz-Ospina and Roser) may provide a useful framework for interpreting this data.\n",

    "I will construct at least two supervised regression models using labor statistics, polity data, and other control variables to predict happiness by country and year. One model will be as interpretable as possible (linear regression or random forest), and one will be more accurate (SVM). Scikit-learn will be used for creating and tuning these models. Cross validation using k-fold validation and bootstrapping would be used for both models. Model fit will be assessed using MSE, and this will subsequently be minimized by balancing the bias-variance trade off as discussed in Chapter 2.2.2 of “An Introduction to Statistical Learning”."
